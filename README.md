## Task: 

Implement Merge Sort algorithm.   
The application must accept input through command line arguments.
The input is a comma separated array of integers. 
The application must support choosing between ascending and descending sorting orders.   

**The output of the application must be:**

 - Algorithm name 
 - Execution time (ms)
 - Comparisons count
 - Swaps count (Merge sort doesn't use `swap` function, so swap counter wasn't implemented)
 - Sorted array

**Required tests:**

 - Input array sorting 
 - Sorting by Asc order of an array, sorted by Asc
 - Sorting by Desc order of an array, sorted by Asc
 - Sorting by Asc order of an array, sorted by Desc
 - Sorting by Desc order of an array, sorted by Desc
